            India achieved independence from British Raj on 15 August 1947 following the Indian independence movement. The independence came through the Indian Independence Act 1947, an Act of the Parliament of the United History of Republic Day Kingdom that partitioned British India intothe two new independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth (later Commonwealth of Nations).India obtained its independence on 15 August 1947 as a constitutional monarchy with George VI as head of state and the Earl Mountbatten as governor-general. The country, though, did not yet have apermanent constitution; instead its laws were based on the modified colonial Government of India Act 1935. On 29 August 1947, a resolution was moved for the appointment of Drafting Committee, which was appointed to draft a permanent constitution, with Dr B R Ambedkar aschairman. While India's Independence Daycelebrates its freedom from British Rule,the Republic Day celebrates the coming into force of its constitution. A draft constitution was prepared by the committee and submitted to the Constituent Assembly on 4 November 1947.The Assembly met, in sessions open to public, for 166 days, spread over aperiod of two years, 11 months and 18 days before adopting the Constitution.After many deliberations and some modifications, the 308 members of the Assembly signed two hand-written copiesof the document (one each in Hindi and English) on 24 January 1950. Two days later which was on 26 January 1950, it came into effect throughout the who lenation. On that day, Dr. Rajendra Prasad's began his first term of office as President of the Indian Union. The Constituent Assembly became the Parliament of India under the transitional provisions of the new Constitution.
